An app that changes an HTML page, PDF, or text into a simple HTML page that Pocket can consume. Pocket has odd, unknown methods of detecting an "article", so this is particlaly achieved by simplifying the HTML and adding 3 paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text to the end of the text.

FAQ:

Will this app intelligently select just the article? Nope. This app's definition of "article" is "literally all visible text." While this is a nightmarishly bad definition of "article," it's better than Pocket saying "I couldn't find an article" on a page that is literally nothing but article.

Will you be enhancing the app to select content more intelligently? Probably not. This is meant to be dead-simple so it's nearly impossible for it to fail. More intelligence means more failure cases.
